# Anki cards layouts
 Custom layouts for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards.
 Anki cards support special [styling](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html).
 This repository offers special styling for Japanese/Korean learning decks.

# TL;DR
Just paste the html into the **Front Template**, **Back Template** and the custom css into **Styling**.
When creating new card types, you can always use tools like [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for checking the card layout before trying it on Anki.
